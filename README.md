In this project, we built an advanced multi-agent AI system to transform how product recommendations work on e-commerce platforms. The system is designed to provide real-time, highly personalized suggestions based on each user's behavior and preferences.

üß† Key Components:
Customer Agent: Understands user behavior, browsing patterns, and purchase history.

Product Agent: Maintains and analyzes product information.

Recommendation Agent: Generates tailored recommendations by combining insights from the Customer and Product Agents.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture:
Ollama-based LLMs (Large Language Models) running on-premise for fast, secure processing without relying on cloud services.

Embedding models to create semantic representations of users and products.

SQLite as a lightweight, efficient database for storing and querying user-product interactions.

Custom APIs for communication between agents.

Web scrapers and ML tools to keep product data fresh and ensure smarter recommendations.

üöÄ What Makes It Special:
Hyper-personalization: Every recommendation is tailored using multiple intelligent agents working together.

Modular and Scalable: Easy to update and expand as technology evolves.

Privacy-Conscious: Keeps data local and secure using on-prem infrastructure.

Improved Engagement: More relevant suggestions mean happier users and better sales outcomes.

This system offers a modern, intelligent alternative to traditional recommendation engines by making them more adaptable, accurate, and future-ready.
